The vehicle has required repairs to suspension components to pass MOT tests, with the most recent major defect in 2023 involving the front suspension arm.\n\nStructural corrosion is becoming increasingly evident, progressing from exhaust joints in 2016 to more general underside corrosion by 2024, including structural components. This corrosion has not yet compromised structural integrity but bears monitoring.\n\nThe vehicle's braking system shows recurring minor issues including grabbing and component wear, which align with known technical service bulletins for this model regarding braking efficiency.\n\nThe emergence of oil leaks in the most recent MOT, while not deemed excessive, could indicate developing engine sealing issues that may require attention.",
