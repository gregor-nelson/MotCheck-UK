The most recent failure in 2023 for suspension arm bush wear suggests ongoing suspension system degradation despite previous repairs.\n\n## Summary Notes\n\nThis Honda CR-V shows multiple recurring technical issues that align with known manufacturer concerns. The vehicle exhibits a progressive pattern of suspension component wear, particularly affecting anti-roll bar linkages and suspension arm bushes. Structural corrosion is becoming increasingly evident, with the latest MOT noting corrosion of the vehicle structure. Oil leaks have recently developed, and there is a history of brake system irregularities including service brake grabbing. \n\nThe frequency of suspension-related issues suggests this is a particular weakness for this vehicle. While most issues have been addressed sufficiently to pass subsequent MOT tests, the recurring nature of suspension and corrosion problems indicates potential long-term durability concerns. The current condition, as reflected in the October 2024 MOT with multiple advisories, suggests active monitoring of suspension components, braking system, and corrosion progression is warranted.",
